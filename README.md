We'd like to introduce you to the <i><b>"Charge Your EV"</b></i> app, which aims to provide the general public with areas with several charging stations so that people don't have to worry about finding charging stations nearby. Our app will assist you in locating nearby charging stations as well as give you with extensive information about nearby charging stations.

## Abstract

The world is moving towards the future, where everything is going to be streamlined and smart. In today's world, people are living a very fast-paced lifestyle and it's the era of innovation. The innovation in the field of transportation has resulted in the invention of electric vehicles. The cars are zero-emission environment friendly. Electric vehicles are also called EVs.


The search for "Electric Cars" is at an all-time high, according to Google Trends, with queries more than tripling since 2009. This is a positive sign that the world is shifting to electric automobiles (EVs).

## The innovation in this application:-

There aren’t many charging facilities for electric vehicles (EVs). If you don’t know where you need to charge your electric vehicle, you might not be able to find it. Our initiative intends to assist street-based charging stations in detecting electric vehicles based on their location so that they may receive better location assistance.
